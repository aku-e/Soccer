# Soccer

Built following Sleitnick's [Knit game tutorial Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mtVyBXkXs) 

I adapted the code to use the updated [Knit API](https://sleitnick.github.io/Knit/api/), the updated [Component v2 API](https://sleitnick.github.io/RbxUtil/api/Component/) and [Trove](https://sleitnick.github.io/RbxUtil/api/Trove/) instead of Maid.

As a bonus I included my configuration of the tooling I used to build this game via VSCode and version control it in Git

- Rojo: to sync files that you have edited on the filesystem into roblox studio
- Remodel: to pull assets from the build file to store in Git
- Wally:  to install libraries such as Knit
